Perhaps, it is not as fun as buying a Tesla or putting solar panels on the roof. In a world where we like to flaunt our allegiance and show our actions, being energy efficient is like being a silent hero, working for one's own sake, and for the planet's."

It is no surprise that the electricity sector is the largest contributor of greenhouse gases on the planet. The burning of coal, natural gas, or oil for power and heat generates carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), among other gases in smaller concentrations. CO2 with its atmospheric concentration of more than 80%, is the biggest contributor to global warming. In this article, let’s just focus on CO2."

A kWh is a standard unit used to measure energy. Since energy is power multiplied by time, whether you use 1kW power in 1 hour or 100 watts in 10 hours, your total energy consumption will be 1 kWh. Every gram of fossil fuel burnt to produce energy emits CO2 which is about ~2 pounds/kWh when using coal and ~1 pound/kWh when using natural gas."

If 23% of this comes from coal and 39% comes from natural gas, then that’s 25 pounds of CO2 cloud released per household per day. Now multiply that by the number of homes in USA — 128 million."

And imagine that cloud getting bigger each day and reaching up to 9000 pounds in a year? CO2 also has a long life, so this large black cloud will stay over your house for your whole life. And since gas occupies a very large space, I guarantee you this looks ugly.\n\nThen imagine the same thing on every neighbor’s house?"

However, if you replace that with ten 15W LEDs that stay on for ~8 hours each day, that’s 1.2 kWh or ~1–2 pounds of CO2 emitted each day.\n\nReplacing regular house lights with LEDs can bring down related CO2 emissions by ~80%."
